<h1>Hospital Waiting Times in Northern Ireland</h1>

<p>This is my second milestone project for the Code Institute. Regarding my choice for this project, at first I had a hard time deciding what to do as with the options available for the project I had many ideas.
After some deliberation, I made the choice to do an interactive dashboard as I found that to be the most intriguing option. In terms of the dataset, I tried many of the options available on the internet and it took
me a while to finally rest on the one that is the basis for my project. As I started working with the current dataset I found the results of combining the data with the dc charts to be very interesting and knew that 
I would be able to create something that would be both visually interesting to look at but also that would be interesting in terms of what the data was showing.</p>

<h2>UX</h2>

<p>One of my favourite TV shows is Grey's Anatomy and when I watch it I always notice how busy their Emergency Room is. On top of that, there is always a story in the news about how long people have to wait to be seen
in A&E in the UK. With so much emphasis being put on this issue, I came to the conclusion that it must be a topic of interest for a lot of people, but they might not know how or where to access the information that would 
allow them to better understand what they are seeing in the media, or if they have researched it, they might be bombarded with numbers and information that makes them more confused than before they began. I therefore decided
that taking such data, that was relevant to my part of the UK which is Northern Ireland, and converting that in to a visual format with graphs would allow people to easily see and understand exactly what all of this information
is saying. The dashboard will show how long people wait in A&E on a yearly basis, which month is the worst in terms of waiting times, which hospitals have the highest waiting times. Also as a user of the website I would expect the
graphs to be interactive and I would be able to see my interaction with the data have an immediate effect on the other graphs.</p>

<h3>Project Objectives</h3>

<ul>
<li>Be a reference point for people who are interested in finding out more about statistics regarding waiting times in A&E Departments</li>
<li>Provide interactive graphs that can relay different pieces of information to the user when different options are selected</li>
<li>Encourage/Promote further research by the user in to the subject material being displayed</li>
</ul>
